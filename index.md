# Meg South's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing python code that I have written during my time as a student. The examples of code below were extracted from assignments and projects that have been completed as part of undergraduate coursework. 

**Box Plots**

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to create a series of boxplots](boxplot.md) showing reaction time in a dataframe. This was code that was written as part of an assignment.

**For Loops & Conversions**

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to create a for loop that would convert reaction time to milliseconds](rt_for_loop.md). This was code that was written as part of an assignment.

**Picking out Specific Data**

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to find the first women to win a Nobel Prize](first_woman_nobel.md) within a dataframe containing the winners from 1901-2016. Fun fact, turns out it was Marie Curie in 1903 for the Nobel Prize in Physics. This was part of a task in a project called "A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners" found on DataCamp.

**Calculations & Scatterplots with Seaborn**

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to figure out the ages of Nobel Prize winners at the time of receiving the award](age_nobel_winners.md). The ages were then used to create a scatterplot with a trendline using Seaborn. This was part of a task in a project called "A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners" found on DataCamp.

**Tidy Data by Dropping Columns**

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to drop columns out of a dataframe](drop_columns.md) so that only relevant information was left behind. This was part of a task in a project called "The Hottest Topics in Machine Learning" found on DataCamp.

**Creating a Wordcloud**

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to create a wordcloud](wordcloud.md). This word cloud represents commonly found words in titles of research papers that were created during the NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems) conferences from 1987-2017. This was part of a task in a project called "The Hottest Topics in Machine Learning" found on DataCamp.
