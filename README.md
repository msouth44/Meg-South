# Age and Gray Matter 
This was a project that I created to explore the relationship between how age affects the amount gray matter within the brain. This project uses  a dataset that was provided by the OASIS Database. The dataset contains data from 416 particpants (N=416), ages ranging from 18 to 96 years of age. The dataset uses male and female particapnts who have and have not been diagnosised with Alzheimers. [Here](age_gray_matter_volume.md) I've included the full project to showcase the workflow and steps taken from the beginning to the end of the project. Below are samples taken from the project that showcase some of the code used throughout. 

Dataset Reference: OASIS: Cross-Sectional: Principal Investigators: D. Marcus, R, Buckner, J, Csernansky J. Morris; P50 AG05681, P01 AG03991, P01 AG026276, R01 AG021910, P20 MH071616, U24 RR021382

**Linear Regression** 

This is a sample of the [linear regression](linear_regression_agm.md) that was done in the Age and Gray Matter Project. 

**Sorting Particapnts into Age Categories**

This is a sample of [how participants where sorted into age categories](bin_participants.md) in the Age and Gray Matter Project. 

**Creating a New Data Frame to Showcase Age and Gray Matter Means**

This is a sample of [how a data frame was created](new_dataframe_agm.md) to be used to compare gray matter means to the relationship that was seen in the linear regression in the Age and Gray Matter Project.

# Heart Failure Clinical Records
This was a project were I was interested in playing around and exploring the data without any specific goals. I was more interested in seeing how I could play around with code going off of knowledge that I have obtained though reading textbooks and research in anatomy and physiology. I started with seeing if there was a relationship between ejection fraction and creatinine phosphokinase levels as creatinine phosphokinase is a marker of muscle tissue damage. It was interesting to see that the data indicated that there was no relationship which lead me to just play around with the data. [Here](heart_failure.md) I've included the full project to showcase the workflow and steps taken from the beginning to the end of the project. Below are samples taken from the project that showcase some of the code used throughout.

This dataset was obtained through the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The original dataset version was collected by Tanvir Ahmad, Assia Munir, Sajjad Haider Bhatti, Muhammad Aftab, and Muhammad Ali Raza (Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan) and made available by them on FigShare under the Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0: freedom to share and adapt the material) copyright in July 2017. 

The current version of the dataset was elaborated by Davide Chicco (Krembil Research Institute, Toronto, Canada) and donated to the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository under the same Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) copyright in January 2020.

This is a sample of code for [the descriptive statistics and histogram plot](seaborn_stats.md) that was done in the Heart Failure Clinical Records Project.

This is a sample of code for [the for loop](levels_loop.md) thats was done in the Heart Failure Clinical Records Project.

# NESC 3505 Assignments

# Miscellaneous
These are samples that were created through projects done using DataCamp. These samples show other skills that have been obtained through NESC 3505 course work but do not directly tie into the course curriculm.

This sample showcases code that was used to create a [wordcloud](wordcloud.md) that was done in the *The Hotetst Topics in Machine Learning* project found on DataCamp.

This Sample showcases code that was used to create a [Seaborn scatter plot](age_nobel_winners-3.md) that was done in the *A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners* project found on DataCamp.

# Demos
These are demos that were created as part of NESC 3505 course work to help peers learn to code and tackle tasks within the cirriculum. My demos focused on the learning process and provide information on learning fundamentals such as notetaking and motivation. 

This [demo](taking_notes.pdf) provides insight into how I as a student took notes from DataCamp and formated them into a [personal cheatsheet](matplotlib_notes.pdf).

This [demo](motivation.pdf) summarizes a podcast and provides insight on how to stay motivated during the learning stages of coding. 

This [demo](downloading_markdown.pdf) is a tutorial on how to download markdown files from CoCal using Safari and fixing .png file issues.
