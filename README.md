**Age and Gray Matter**

This was a project that I created to explore the relationship between how age affects the amount gray matter within the brain. This project uses  a dataset that was provided by the OASIS Database. The dataset contains data from 416 particpants (N=416), ages ranging from 18 to 96 years of age. The dataset uses male and female particapnts who have and have not been diagnosised with Alzheimers. [Here](age_gray_matter_volume.md) I've included the full project to showcase the workflow and steps taken from the beginning to the end of the project. Below are samples taken from that project that showcase some of the code used throughout. 

Dataset Reference: OASIS: Cross-Sectional: Principal Investigators: D. Marcus, R, Buckner, J, Csernansky J. Morris; P50 AG05681, P01 AG03991, P01 AG026276, R01 AG021910, P20 MH071616, U24 RR021382

***Linear Regression***

This is a sample of the [linear regression](linear_regression_agm.md) that was done in the Age and Gray Matter Project. 

***Sorting Particapnts into Age Categories***

This is a sample of [how participants where sorted into age categories](bin_participants.md) in the Age and Gray Matter Project. 

***Creating a New Data Frame to Showcase Age and Gray Matter Means***

This is a sample of [how a data frame was created](new_dataframe_agm.md) to be used to compare gray matter means to the relationship that was seen in the linear regression in the Age and Gray Matter Project.
