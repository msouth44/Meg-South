# Meg South's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing python code that I have written during my time as a student. The examples of code below were extracted from assignments and projects that have been completed as part of undergraduate coursework. 

**Box Plots**

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to create a series of boxplots](boxplot.md) showing reaction time in a dataframe. This was code that was written as part of an assignment.

**For Loops & Conversions**

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to create a for loop that would convert reaction time to milliseconds](rt_for_loop.md). This was code that was written as part of an assignment.
