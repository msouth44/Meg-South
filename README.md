**My professional python coding portfolio

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to create a series of boxplots](boxplot.md). This was code that was written as part of an assignment.

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to create a for loop that would convert reaction time to milliseconds](rt_for_loop.md). This was code that was written as part of an assignment.

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to find the first women to win a nobel prize](first_woman_nobel.md) within a dataframe containing the winners from 1901-2016. Fun fact, it was Marie Curie in 1903 for the Nobel Prize in Physics. This was part of a task in a project called "A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners" found on DataCamp.

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to figure out the ages of Nobel Prize winners at the time of receiving the award](age_nobel_winners.md). The ages were then used to create a scatterplot with a trendline using Seaborn. This was part of a task in a project called "A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners" found on DataCamp.

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to drop columns out of a dataframe](drop_columns.md) so that only relevant information was left behind. This was part of a task in a project called "The Hottest Topics in Machine Learning" found on DataCamp.

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to create a wordcloud](wordcloud.md). This word cloud represents commonly found words in titles of research papers that were created during the NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems) conference from 1987-2017. This was part of a task in a project called "The Hottest Topics in Machine Learning" found on DataCamp.
