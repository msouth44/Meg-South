# Meg South's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing python code that I have written during my time as a student. The examples of code below were extracted from assignments and projects that have been completed as part of undergraduate coursework. 

**Age and Gray Matter**

This was a project that I created to explore the relationship between how age affects the amount gray matter within the brain. This project uses  a dataset that was provided by OASIS. The dataset contains data from 416 particpants (N=416), ages ranging from 18 to 96 years of age. The dataset uses male and female particapnts who have and have not been diagnosised with Alzheimers. [Here](age_gray_matter_volume.md) I've included the full project to showcase the workflow and steps taken from the beginning to the end of the project. Below are samples taken from that project that showcase some of the code used throughout. 

Dataset Reference: OASIS: Cross-Sectional: Principal Investigators: D. Marcus, R, Buckner, J, Csernansky J. Morris; P50 AG05681, P01 AG03991, P01 AG026276, R01 AG021910, P20 MH071616, U24 RR021382

***Linear Regression***

This is a sample of the [linear regression](linear_regression_agm.md) that was done in the Age and Gray Matter Project. 


**Box Plots**

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to create a series of boxplots](boxplot.md) showing reaction time in a dataframe. This was code that was written as part of an assignment.

**For Loops & Conversions**

Here is an example of [code that I wrote to create a for loop that would convert reaction time to milliseconds](rt_for_loop.md). This was code that was written as part of an assignment.
